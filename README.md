MultiGesturesControlCenter
For some reason we have multi Touch, but companies does not use it to make something useful.
For real i want in the android OS system a control center that can be activated with multi touch gestures,
using different gestures like the old on and off switches, 
but activate them in different ways; 
on the Android home screen (e.g. two fingers vertically up for on and down for off,
three fingers vertically up for on and down for off, 
four fingers vertically up for on and down for off); 
and (two fingers horizontally left for on and right for off, 
three fingers horizontally left for on and right for off, 
four fingers horizontally left for on and right for off) 
and a rotation well that calibrates different controls depending on how many finger you use to rotate it; 
(e.g. on Android home screen; 
rotate with two fingers to calibrate sound, 
three fingers for brightness and so on)
